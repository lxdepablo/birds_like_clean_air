# Birds Like Clean Air
A case study using Sage/Crocus data to study the effect of air quality-related disturbances on bird species richness in the Chicago area. There are three steps in the analysis pipeline. First, there is a [data pulling script](https://github.com/lxdepablo/birds_like_clean_air/blob/main/code/pull_crocus_data.R) which downloads data from the CROCUS API, using the [sageDataR](https://github.com/lxdepablo/sageDataR) library. These data are written to the [data folder](https://github.com/lxdepablo/birds_like_clean_air/tree/main/data).
